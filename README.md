### Webcast content guidelines
- The simplest guideline is that webcast topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in a CD Summit talk.
- No straight product pitches. It is okay to do a comparison of part of the landscape (e.g., storage), but webinars should not be promotional.
- Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source

### How to pick a topic

- The audience is interested in technical demos that help them solve problems and want to be able to ask your expert questions.
- Our audience spans from developers, architects, CIOs, and CTOs. Topics should be tailored for which of those audiences you're trying to target.
- We are emphasizing SEO optimization this year to drive more registrations and views after the fact, so please take some extra time to make sure your abstract is highlighting important keywords. We'll be making suggestions as well.
